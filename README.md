# flashcard-generator

### Overview

Created the backend for a basic flashcard application which has two types of flashcards:

1. **Basic** flashcards, which have a front (_"Who was the first president of the United States?"_), and a back (_"George Washington"_).

2. **Cloze-Deleted** flashcards, which present _partial_ text (_"... was the first president of the United States."_), and the full text when the user requests it (_"George Washington was the first president of the United States."_)

User will be able to select a type of flashcard with a CLI prompt and then input questions/answers on prompt.  The app will then push input into a document in JSON format.   User can review all flashcards within the file.
